 	<p class="techTxt">Ori will be initally design to be a desktop app because most of its features require more the use of a computer over a phone. For example, it would be confortable to edit contracts and proposals on the computer rather than on a phone.  
    I have also gone with a LAMP stack approach due to its relational database.</p>

	<p class="paraLeft"> My name is Sabrina GÃ³mez, I am currently studying Interactive Media Specialist at Fanshawe College. Before this program, I worked as Visual Communication Designer back in my home country, Colombia. I have a love for detail, colors, and everything related to design which compliments well my new knowledge in code and has become very useful with my interests in Front-end development.</p>

	<p class="paraRight">Ori was inspired due to my own personal struggles when I first started out as a freelancer after university. Think back, I would have liked to have had an easy and understandable resource to go to for such formalities that were hard for me to understand back then. I designed Ori to be simple, user friendly and visually appealing. If you have any further questions about Ori or anything else please feel free to contact me! <span style="color: #55E0CB;
